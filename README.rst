Reaktoro is a unified framework for modeling chemically reactive systems. It provides methods for chemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations for multiphase systems. Reaktoro is mainly developed in C++ for performance reasons. A Python interface is available for a more convenient and simpler use. Currently, Reaktoro can interface with two widely used geochemical software: `PHREEQC <http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/>`_ and `GEMS <http://gems.web.psi.ch/>`_.

Quick example
=============

Here is a simple C++ code using Reaktoro to perform a multiphase chemical equilibrium calculation:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <Reaktoro/Reaktoro.hpp>

    using namespace Reaktoro;

    int main()
    {
        ChemicalEditor editor;
        editor.addAqueousPhase("H2O NaCl CaCO3 CO2");
        editor.addGaseousPhase("CO2(g)");
        editor.addMineralPhase("Calcite");

        ChemicalSystem system(editor);

        EquilibriumProblem problem(system);
        problem.add("H2O", 1, "kg");
        problem.add("CO2", 1, "mol");
        problem.add("NaCl", 0.7, "mol");
        problem.add("CaCO3", 1, "g");

        ChemicalState state = equilibrate(problem);

        state.output("result.txt");
    }


This calculation could also be performed using Reaktoro's Python interface:

.. code-block:: python

    from reaktoro import *

    editor = ChemicalEditor()
    editor.addAqueousPhase("H2O NaCl CaCO3 CO2")
    editor.addGaseousPhase("CO2(g)")
    editor.addMineralPhase("Calcite")

    system = ChemicalSystem(editor)

    problem = EquilibriumProblem(system)
    problem.add("H2O", 1, "kg")
    problem.add("CO2", 1, "mol")
    problem.add("NaCl", 0.7, "mol")
    problem.add("CaCO3", 1, "g")

    state = equilibrate(problem)

    state.output("result.txt")

Developing Quick-Start
======================

In order to start developing, you'll need to build Reaktoro from sources. There are two ways: install the dependencies manually, as described `here <http://www.reaktoro.org/installation.html>`_, or using Conda. `Conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_ is a tool for managing packages, dependencies and environments for multiple languages, including Python and C++, and supporting multiple platforms: Windows, Linux and macOS. In order to start developing Reaktoro using Conda, these are the steps:

#. Install Miniconda, pick the 64-bit installer that uses the latest Python version from: `conda.io/miniconda.html <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.
#. Add ``conda-forge`` as a channel: ``conda config --append channels conda-forge``
#. Install ``conda-devenv``: ``conda install -n base conda-devenv``
#. Create an environment for Reaktoro, from the repository root directory: ``conda devenv``
#. Activate the environment: ``source activate reaktoro`` from Linux/macOS or ``activate reaktoro`` from Windows
#. Create a ``build`` directory and call ``cmake`` from it (for now check the `.travis.yml` file for an example on CMake parameters), OR, on Windows, call the ``inv msvc`` task to generate a project under ``build\msvc`` directory, open it in the IDE and build the ``INSTALL`` project. (``inv`` is short for ``invoke``, from the `Invoke <https://www.pyinvoke.org/>`_ tool.)

Note: an ``inv compile`` task will be added in the future in order to simplify compilation in all platforms.
